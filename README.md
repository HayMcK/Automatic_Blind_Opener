This project is designed using an arduino, PIR sensor, photoresistor, and stepper motor. The photoresistor measures the level of 
light within a room, and when low enough, if the PIR sensor detects human movement, the blinds open will open via the stepper motor.
After a delay where no motion is detected using a clock that resets each time movement is detected, the blinds will automatically 
close again, resetting the loop to the beginning.
